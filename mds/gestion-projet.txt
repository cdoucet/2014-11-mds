Cédric, Cécile : project management

1- what is it, what is for ?

  - roles: customer, manager, developer, tester, user (responsibility
    assignment matrix RACI = Responsible + Approver + Consulted +
    Informed)

  - parameters: team size, team experience, release date, ...

  - brief story of developments models

  - famous examples of failure
  - risks of wrong management for each involved person (cf roles)

2- Waterfall, V-Model: pros and cons

  plan driven: fixed features 

  Waterfall: analysis -> design -> develop -> test -> deploy

  V-Model: functional requirements (general, detailed -
  architecture), design (developer), implementation, tests (unit,
  integration, validation), maintenance

  - following a plan
  - contract negociation
  - processes and tools
  - comprehensive documentation

  - test at the end

3- agile: 

  value/vision driven: fixed cost and schedule

  - brief story of agile methods
    => framework Scrum (and XP)

  - roles: Scrum master (stackeholder process cf. RACI), product owner
    (stackeholder product), development team (self-management)

  quality = working software or ROI

  - responding to change (flexibility)
  - customer collaboration (visibility)
  - individuals and interactions (feedback)
  - working software (quality) -> test first TDD

  pair programming (XP), code review

  product backlog -> sprint backlog -> sprint with daily meetings ->
  potentially shippable product increment

  quality improvement = PDCA Plan Do Check Act/Adjust (introspection)
  traditional: only 1 PDCA 
  Scrum: 3 PDCA = 
  	 1- customer communication 
  	    Check = CCC  -> Adjust = product backlog 
	    -> Plan = customer -> Do = demonstration (product owner)
	 2- working software
  	    Check = daily meeting -> Adjust 
	    -> Plan -> Do
	 3- collaboration and responsabilities
  	    Check -> Adjust = sprint 
	    -> Plan = developer -> Do = retrospective
